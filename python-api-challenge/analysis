Analysis

1 . It was noticed in the analysis that cities had higher temperatures the closer they were to the equator.
    Applying linear regression to the north hemisphern cities, 
        there was found to be a high positive correlation between the maximum temperature and the latitude. 
    The data showed that the closer the latitude to the equator, the higher the temperature was and vice versa
    This wasn't observed with the southern hemisphere cities as the regression level was low positive.
    This could be due to the sample size of the data and that there were over twice as many cities ound in the northern 
        hemisphere than the southern. This geographly makes sense.
        
2.  The data could not conclude that there was a correlation between the humidity vs latitude of cities nor latitude vs 
        cloudiness and latitude vs wind speed. Thios was thesame in  both northern and southern hemispheres
        
3.  There seemed to be a link between humidity and latitude more in northern hemisphere however the regression model does not find
        any strong correlation. More information could be pulled out if there was a humidity vs max temperature.
        
4.  On average it was found minimum temperatures in the southern hemisper were a lot warmer then northern on the 1/14/21. 
        Averages found were 2C in the northern and 23C in southern hemisphere
        This could be due to the seasons that both hemispheres are experiencing. 
        Also, due to more ocean to land in the southern hemisphere, temperatures do not shift very low
